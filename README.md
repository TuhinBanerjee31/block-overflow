# EDU CHAIN REGIONALS

BlockOverflow is a decentralized, Web3-based Q&A platform modeled after Stack Overflow. It utilizes blockchain technology to ensure transparency, immutability, and fair reward distribution for contributors. Users can post questions by setting a bounty, which is held in escrow upon submission. Other users can provide answers, and if the question poster finds a response helpful, they can release the bounty to the contributor by accepting their answer.
